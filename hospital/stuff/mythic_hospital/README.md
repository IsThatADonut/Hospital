# For now this is primarily based on the abandoned Mythic Hostpial
(https://github.com/Quostix/mythic_hospital)

This is a lightweight hosptial & limb damage resource. This was largely done as an experiment so some of it is rough around the edges. Furthermore this is very big hobby project for me to re-learn LUA after not having used it proffesionally for a few years.
