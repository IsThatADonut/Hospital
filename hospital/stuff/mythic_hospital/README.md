- Interaction during treatment of wounds by either Civs or Police/EMT
    - e.g. Press [E] to perform initial accessment 
    - e.g. Press [E] to treat gunshot wound to lower body
    - e.g. Press [E] to administer morphine to patient
    - e.g. Patients finger is broken, press [E] to add a splint
    - e.g. You are currently bleeding out press [E] to call EMS, or seek medical treatment soon
- Allow for EMS to check the status of downed Peds to start treatment
- Implement hospital beds as part of the treatment and ensure that they remove side effects
